# fast-norm-cuda

A fast, yet specialized, RMSNorm/LayerNorm implementation

This library is under development. Currently, only some special cases are supported, and the performance is not yet fully optimized.

- [x] RMSNorm
- [ ] LayerNorm
- [ ] More dtypes
- [x] More shapes
- [ ] Accelerate if no wgrad
- [ ] Performance tuning
